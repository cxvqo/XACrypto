A multi-purpose Cryptography library in Java. Working on it day by day, slowly. Someday this will be complete, today is not that day.
To be clear, this is **NOT** mean't to be a replacement/alternative to BouncyCastle. Instead, it is meant to include what BouncyCastle does not have.

### Current Objective: ZekerRijndael (custom from-scratch AES-128 block cipher)
### Note: i'm creating ZekerRijndael as it can be used for creating the following encryption ciphers: AES-CTR; AES-OFB; AES-CFB. Block modes include AES-CBC; AES-ECB. And of course AES-GCM + ASE-CCM

## View the "zekerRijndael" branch to see inprogress work.

Use `setopt interactivecomments` (zsh only) to allow using `#` for comments if you see errors like `zsh: command not found: #`

Ensure Java + javac are installed, on MacOS it can be installed with Homebrew by running `brew install openjdk`

You will also need maven installed.

To compile:

1. git clone https://github.com/Geprivilegieerde-Anonimiteit-BV/XACrypto.git # download the git repository
2. cd XACrypto
3. mvn clean package

You should find the built jar at target/XACrypto-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
